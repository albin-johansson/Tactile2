# Crashes

This directory contains a selection of stacktraces from previous crashes. This is mainly useful to keep track of causes
of crashes, in order to prevent the same type of crashes in the future. Crashes caused by unhandled exceptions or
assertions will, as long as the stacktrace information is available, have the stacktrace dumped into a `crash.txt` file
next to the executable.
