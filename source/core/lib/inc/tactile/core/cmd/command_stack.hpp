 *              front         |  back

 *
 * - New commands are always added to the back of the sequence. \n
 * - The "clean" index simply refers to a specific state in the command
 *   sequence. Its sole purpose is to track whether any observable changes has
 *   been made since that state. This is particularly useful to track changes to
 *   documents. \n
 * - The current index points to the command that was last executed. If a
 *   command is reverted (using the `undo` function), then this index is moved
 *   to the left but the command stack is otherwise untouched. Similarly, if a
 *   command is repeated after being reverted, this index is incremented and
 *   shifted to the right.
